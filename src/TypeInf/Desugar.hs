Let's de-sugar in a new mini-phase!
1. Read through a file, and while it is reading...
2. Recognize any UsProgData's that appear (those represent data structures like Lists).
3. See if the UsProgData is used by a case (for now) (later we'll get into lambda's and let's).
4. If the answer to 3. is yes, then de-sugar that case (or lambda or let),
  since it is here that we can deduce that Nil is a List, Cons is a List, etc.
  Ex: For case's, it is in seeing a Nil case that we can deduce the thing being case'd is a List.
5. We may have to make small, effortless changes to progBuiltIns and ctxtAddUsProgs, which come before this mini-phase
(in order to get input and output types correct).

RECALL in Struct.Exprs, individual user-level definitions of data structures go like this:
data UsProg = UsProgData TpName [TpVar] [Ctor]    -- lhs, type params, constructors
That last part, the [Ctor], is a list storing all the possible constructors!
We can use that to determine if we are missing any cases,
and know how to de-sugar into the correct constructors.

also RECALL these definitions:
1. UsCase UsTm [CaseUs]                     -- case tm of case*
2. data CaseUs = CaseUs TmName [TmVar] UsTm -- | x a1 ... an -> tm
3. data Case = Case TmName [Param] Term     -- | x (a1 : tp1) ... (an : tpn) -> tm
